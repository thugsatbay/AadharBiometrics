Unique Identification System using fingerprints

The Project aimed at creating a universal ID that can have limitless application of identifying an individual using his fingerprints(thumb) in any real-time environment (banking/e-market/government)

Capturing and recognizing fingerprints based on bifurcation and minutiae points

Capturing the Image in TIFF format, then doing a grayscale operation to convert the format to (0-255) and then doing the thinning process were some internal functions of our tool

Implemented and used SIFT algorithm to detect interest points to detect and match fingerprints

Provided a GUI in C# as interface to perform and show all operations and developed a platform for collecting and validating data
